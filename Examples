# Approximate integral using the Trapezoidal Rule

**Problem:** Approximate the integral
\[
\int_{0}^{1} e^x \, dx
\]
using the Trapezoidal Rule with \(n = 4\) subintervals.

**Goal:** Provide a Python implementation and a short explanation of the steps.

**Expected steps**
1. Partition [0,1] into n = 4 equal subintervals.
2. Compute the trapezoidal sum.
3. Show the approximate numeric value and compare to exact value \(e - 1\).
